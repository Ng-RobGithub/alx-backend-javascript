0x05-Node_JS_basic

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it suitable for server-side development

 Fundamental aspects of Node.js:
 1. JavaScript Runtime: Node.js allows you to execute JavaScript code on the server-side
 2. Event-Driven and Non-Blocking I/O: Node.js is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it efficient and lightweight, ideal for handling concurrent operations.
 3. Modules and npm: Node.js uses a module system based on CommonJS.
 4. Core Modules: Node.js provides a set of built-in modules that offer essential functionalities like file system I/O, networking (HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, etc.)
 5. Asynchronous Programming: Node.js emphasizes asynchronous programming patterns, using callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax to handle operations like file I/O, network requests, and database queries efficiently without blocking the execution thread.
 6. Server-Side Development: Node.js is widely used for building scalable network applications such as web servers, APIs, microservices, real-time applications (chat, gaming), and more.

 To install dependencies, use npm:
 - npm install
- npm run test
- npm run lint
- npm run full-test
